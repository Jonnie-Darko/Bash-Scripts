Ubunu_Kickstarter.sh

This repository contains Bash scripts I chose to create during my time in the OSU Cybersecurity program.

The "Ubuntu_Kickstarter" script is something I wanted to create because I found myself creating several new Ubuntu VMs. When the script is executed it will:
      1. Download several apps and tools for hacking, packet sniffing, Linux customization, etc
      2. Update the machine
      3. Upgrade the machine and apps
      4. Run a "git pull" within my school's directory to update it will the Cybersecurity program's latest directories and files
This program makes setting up a new Ubunut machine very quick and hassle-free. I wanted to use this to save time, as well as help out my fellow classmates experiencing similar needs.







Raiders_of_the_Lost_File.sh

This script is not quite as helpful as the Ubuntu_Kickstarter.sh file, but it does make the "find" command slightly easier. It helps the user find directories and file types such as:
      1. Text files
      2. Shell files
      3. Log files
      4. files without known type. 
I wrote this script to simply help anyone who might be having trouble searching for common file types, but do not have a lot of experience with the Linux command line. This simplifies the task.
